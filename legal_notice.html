            All contents of our website have been created with the utmost care and to the best
            of our knowledge. However, we cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness and
            timeliness of the content. As a service provider, we are responsible for our own
            content on these pages in accordance with § 7 paragraph 1 TMG under the general
            laws. According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, however, we are not obligated as a service provider
            to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate
            circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block
            the use of information according to general laws remain unaffected. However,
            liability in this regard is only possible from the point in time at which a concrete
            infringement of the law becomes known. If we become aware of the above-mentioned
            infringements, we will remove this content immediately.

            A constant review of the contents of the external links is not possible without
            concrete evidence of a violation of the law. In the case of direct or indirect links
            to the websites of third parties that lie outside our area of responsibility, a
            liability obligation would only exist in the case where we become aware of the content
            and it would be technically possible and reasonable for us to prevent use in the case
            of illegal content. This disclaimer also applies to links and references within our
            own website "Name of your domain" from questioners, bloggers, guests of the discussion

            violations, we will remove the external links immediately.
